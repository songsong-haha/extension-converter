Summary: Added pre-compact memory workflow for codex global/local memory.
Local Lessons:
- Use pnpm codex:precompact before compact in extension-converter

Mistakes To Avoid:
- Relying on unstated memory rules
- Not preserving lessons before compaction

Better Approaches:
- Record lessons before compact every time
- Separate global vs local knowledge to reduce noise
