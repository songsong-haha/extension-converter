- changed files: docs/GROWTH_BACKLOG.md, loop/prd.json, loop/progress.txt, src/features/analytics/lib/ga.ts, src/features/converter/components/converter-widget.tsx, src/i18n/messages.ts, tests/e2e/home.spec.ts
- reusable learnings: Keep ad surfaces gated behind post-conversion success state and instrument separate impression/click events so monetization experiments do not contaminate conversion-step behavior.
