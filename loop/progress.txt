- changed files: docs/GROWTH_BACKLOG.md, loop/prd.json, loop/progress.txt, package.json, scripts/qa/track-growth-loop.mjs, tests/e2e/home.spec.ts, tests/track-growth-loop.test.mjs
- reusable learnings: Keep growth dashboard inputs configurable via env-path overrides so loop automation can validate retry-success metrics deterministically with isolated fixtures.
