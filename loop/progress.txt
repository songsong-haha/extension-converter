# Loop Progress Log

## Codebase Patterns
- Carry forward only reusable patterns, not raw logs.

- time (UTC): 2026-02-13T14:45:52Z
- item id: US-001
- changed files: src/app/page.tsx, loop/prd.json, loop/progress.txt
- reusable learnings: Build hero format copy from the format registry to prevent stale marketing text; use a single above-the-fold anchor CTA targeting the converter section for clearer acquisition intent.
- time (UTC): 2026-02-13T14:58:48Z
- item id: US-001
- changed files: src/app/page.tsx, tests/e2e/home.spec.ts, loop/prd.json
- reusable learnings: Keep hero/e2e copy assertions in sync; source visible format lists from format-registry-derived constants to avoid hardcoded drift.

- time (UTC): 2026-02-13T15:07:29Z
- item id: US-002
- changed files: src/features/analytics/lib/ga.ts, src/features/converter/components/converter-widget.tsx, loop/prd.json, loop/progress.txt
- reusable learnings: For pre-conversion drop-off analytics, pair an in-memory guard with sessionStorage and fire on visibility/pagehide to avoid duplicate events while still capturing abandonment.

- time (UTC): 2026-02-13T15:10:44Z
- item id: US-001
- changed files: src/app/page.tsx, tests/e2e/home.spec.ts, loop/progress.txt
- reusable learnings: Keep hero promise copy broad enough for UX polish but back it with registry-derived support text so messaging stays accurate as formats evolve.
- time (UTC): 2026-02-13T15:14:39Z
- item id: US-001
- changed files: src/app/page.tsx, tests/e2e/home.spec.ts, loop/progress.txt
- reusable learnings: When tightening hero messaging, keep one unambiguous primary CTA and update E2E headline matchers in the same change to prevent copy-related regressions.

- time (UTC): 2026-02-13T15:16:37Z
- item id: US-001
- changed files: src/app/page.tsx, loop/progress.txt
- reusable learnings: Keep the hero CTA action-first and short, while deriving support-copy format claims from registry-backed constants so marketing text stays accurate automatically.
- time (UTC): 2026-02-13T15:19:01Z
- item id: US-001
- changed files: src/app/page.tsx, tests/e2e/home.spec.ts, loop/prd.json, loop/progress.txt
- reusable learnings: Keep hero acquisition copy and E2E assertions aligned in the same patch, and generate support claims from format-registry constants to avoid stale CTA messaging.

- time (UTC): 2026-02-13T15:21:37Z
- item id: US-002
- changed files: loop/prd.json, loop/progress.txt
- reusable learnings: Run lint/build/e2e sequentially in this repo during loop validation; running them in parallel can create transient failures around shared test-results and build artifacts.
- time (UTC): 2026-02-13T15:28:53Z
- item id: US-001
- changed files: src/app/page.tsx, loop/progress.txt
- reusable learnings: Keep hero CTA text imperative and specific to the first action, while deriving support claims from registry-backed format constants to avoid stale conversion promises.
- time (UTC): 2026-02-13T15:37:39Z
- item id: US-001
- changed files: src/app/page.tsx, loop/progress.txt
- reusable learnings: Generate hero support claims directly from format-registry-backed constants so CTA copy stays accurate as supported formats evolve.
