  - loop/prd.json
  - loop/progress.txt
  - src/features/converter/components/converter-widget.tsx
  - tests/e2e/home.spec.ts
- reusable learnings:
  - For post-conversion monetization, defer ad rendering until after the primary completion action (download) to reduce UX interference.
  - Keep ad impression tracking tied to actual render conditions to avoid premature analytics events.
