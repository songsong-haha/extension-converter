# Loop Progress Log

## Codebase Patterns
- Carry forward only reusable patterns, not raw logs.

- changed files: src/features/converter/components/converter-widget.tsx, loop/prd.json, loop/progress.txt
- reusable learnings: For session-level abandonment analytics, avoid firing in effect cleanup tied to state changes; fire on page lifecycle signals and reset per-file conversion-start state to prevent false drop-off suppression.

- item id: US-002
- changed files: src/features/converter/components/converter-widget.tsx, loop/prd.json, loop/progress.txt
- reusable learnings: Guard sessionStorage access for pre-conversion drop-off analytics so private-mode/storage failures do not break one-per-session event capture; normalize source-format payload casing for consistent analytics dimensions.

- item id: US-001
- changed files: src/features/converter/components/converter-widget.tsx, tests/e2e/home.spec.ts, loop/prd.json, loop/progress.txt
- reusable learnings: For image-conversion e2e, use a known-valid in-memory tiny GIF payload to avoid canvas decode flakiness; assert trust copy only after successful conversion status.

- time (UTC): 2026-02-13T16:49:05Z
- item id: US-001
- changed files: loop/progress.txt
- reusable learnings: When a loop-selected ticket is already implemented on its task branch, re-run the full gate (`lint`, `build`, `test:e2e`) before promotion and record a fresh progress checkpoint for traceability.
