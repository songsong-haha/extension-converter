- Reusable learnings: Gate UX experiments with a single env flag and still include `experiment_variant` in both control and variant analytics payloads for clean downstream segmentation.
- Reusable learnings: Keep experiment UI localized through existing message contracts; this avoids hard-coded strings and keeps e2e assertions stable across locales.
