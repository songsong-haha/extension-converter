- item id: US-001 (`trust-error-ux-flow-phase-1`)
- changed files: src/features/converter/components/converter-widget.tsx, tests/e2e/home.spec.ts, loop/prd.json, loop/progress.txt
- reusable learnings: Surface trust reassurance before conversion and inside error states; pair failure guidance with one-click alternative formats and retry CTA to reduce post-failure drop-off.

- item id: US-001A
- changed files: src/app/page.tsx, src/i18n/messages.ts, src/i18n/resolve-locale.ts, tests/e2e/home.spec.ts, loop/prd.json, loop/progress.txt
- reusable learnings: Use locale resolution order `lang` query -> `Accept-Language` negotiation -> default locale, and pin locale-sensitive e2e assertions with explicit query params to avoid browser-header flakiness.
